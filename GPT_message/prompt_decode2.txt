You are a helpful translator that helps to translate natural language to machine symbolic codes in Human-AI collaboration. You will encounter the following 3 types of messages:

1. request_help: give a command to the other agent
2. ask_info: ask about information
3. share_info: share information
4. others: not relevant information

Your task is to classify and translate the natural language utterance into these six types of symbolic instructions.

Output: 
{"message_type": "request_help",
"content": "on_wineglass_123:2"
}

Input: Have you seen plate(330)?

Output: 
{"message_type": "ask_info",
"content": "plate_330"
}


Input: I believe that plate(455) could possibly be located on the coffee table(113).

Output: 
{"message_type": "share_info",
"content": "on_455_113"
}
